Simple LAN Network Project Documentation
Objective: Create a functional LAN with two PCs connected via a switch and verify connectivity.

1. Network Topology Diagram


Devices Used:

1 × Cisco 2960 Switch

2 × PCs

Connections:

PC0 → Switch Port Fa0/1 (Straight-through cable)

PC1 → Switch Port Fa0/2 (Straight-through cable)

2. Device Configurations
PC0 Configuration
IP Address: 192.168.1.1
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: Not required (same subnet)

Steps:
Open PC0 > Desktop tab > IP Configuration.
Set to Static addressing.
Enter the IP and subnet mask.
PC1 Configuration
IP Address: 192.168.1.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: Not required (same subnet)

Steps:
Open PC1 > Desktop tab > IP Configuration.
Set to Static addressing.
Enter the IP and subnet mask.

3. Testing Connectivity
Ping Test from PC0 to PC1
Open PC0’s Command Prompt.

Run:
ping 192.168.1.2  

Expected Output:
Reply from 192.168.1.2: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128  
Reply from 192.168.1.2: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128  
Reply from 192.168.1.2: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128  
Reply from 192.168.1.2: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128  
Ping statistics for 192.168.1.2:  
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss)  
4. Troubleshooting
Issue: Ping fails.

Solution:

Verify IP addresses and subnet masks on both PCs.

Check cable connections (ensure straight-through cables are used).

Confirm switch port lights are green (indicating active links).

5. Conclusion
The LAN network is successfully configured. Both PCs can communicate over the switch, confirming proper IP addressing and physical connectivity.
